# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **MokoWaaS**!

This repository is governed by **[MokoStandards](https://github.com/mokoconsulting-tech/MokoStandards)** — the authoritative source of coding standards, workflows, and policies for all Moko Consulting repositories.

## Branch Strategy

| Branch | Purpose | Deploys To |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `main` | Bleeding edge — all development merges here | CI only |
| `dev/XX.YY.ZZ` | Feature development | Dev server (version: "development") |
| `version/XX` | Stable frozen snapshot | Demo + RS servers |

### Development Workflow

```
1. Create branch:   git checkout -b dev/XX.YY.ZZ/my-feature
2. Develop + test    (dev server auto-deploys on push)
3. Open PR → main    (squash merge only)
4. Auto-release      (version branch + tag + GitHub Release created automatically)
```

### Branch Naming

| Prefix | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `dev/XX.YY.ZZ` | Feature development (e.g., `dev/02.00.00/add-extrafields`) |
| `version/XX` | Stable release (auto-created, never manually pushed) |
| `chore/` | Automated sync branches (managed by MokoStandards) |

> **Never use** `feature/`, `hotfix/`, or `release/` prefixes — they are not part of the MokoStandards branch strategy.

## Commit Conventions

Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat(scope): add new extrafield for invoice tracking
fix(sql): correct column type in llx_mytable
docs(readme): update installation instructions
chore(deps): bump enterprise library to 04.02.30
```

**Valid types:** `feat` | `fix` | `docs` | `chore` | `ci` | `refactor` | `style` | `test` | `perf` | `revert` | `build`

## Pull Request Workflow

1. **Branch** from `main` using `dev/XX.YY.ZZ/description` format
2. **Bump** the patch version in `README.md` before opening the PR
3. **Title** must be a valid conventional commit subject line
4. **Target** `main` — squash merge only (merge commits are disabled)
5. **CI checks** must pass before merge

### What Happens on Merge

When your PR is merged to `main`, these workflows run automatically:

1. **sync-version-on-merge** — auto-bumps patch version, propagates to all file headers
2. **auto-release** — creates `version/XX` branch, git tag, and GitHub Release
3. **deploy-demo / deploy-rs** — deploys to demo and RS servers (if `src/**` changed)

## Coding Standards

All contributions must follow [MokoStandards](https://github.com/mokoconsulting-tech/MokoStandards):
