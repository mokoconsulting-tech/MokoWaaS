## Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainer

**GitHub**: @mokoconsulting-tech

**Authority**: Final decision-making authority on all matters for this repository.

**Authority**: Submit changes via pull requests.

**Requirements**:

## Decision-Making

All changes must be submitted as pull requests. The maintainer (@mokoconsulting-tech)

### Sole Operator Policy

This organization operates under a **sole operator** model. The maintainer (@mokoconsulting-tech)
is the sole employee and owner and may self-approve pull requests when no second reviewer is
available. The following requirements remain mandatory regardless:

1. **Pull Requests Required** — all changes to protected branches go through a PR.
2. **Automated Checks** — all CI checks must pass before merging.
3. **Audit Trail** — issues, pull requests, and commit history are preserved.
4. **Documentation** — changes are documented in `CHANGELOG.md`.
